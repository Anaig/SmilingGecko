# Smiling Gecko : Transparent food supply chain process

##Our objective:
Today food supply chains are conventionally opaque, preventing the consummers to pursue their environmental, social and health values.
Smiling Gecko aims at giving people back control over the whole food chain lifecyle. A user can invest into products at a local farm, and support the farmer in having a better environment impact, social impact and personal health. 
Blockchain technology, combined with IoT data and Machine Learning, is the assurance of a transparent good lifecycle from farm to fork.
